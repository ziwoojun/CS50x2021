# CS50x2021
Ziwoo Jun's CS50x2021 Problem Set Folder

Hello! I have started CS50 Last June, but I have not been able to set aside time to finish it through. I noticed that CS50 has changed for 2021, and decided that I should work from the beginning once again to refresh my memory. I have also realized that my progress says that I am up to Week 5, but all of my progress in individual assignments have been renewed (0). Hopefully, resubmitting it through here will solve this problem!
